The dataset we chose is called Adult Dataset is being provided by UC Irvine Machine Leaning Repository. The multivariate dataset contains census data that is used to predict if an individual makes over $50K a year. It has 48842 instances and 14 attributes.x The data for this dataset was collected by Barry Becker in 1994 who then donated it to UCI in 1996.It was collected for classification and research purposes, and to determine whether a person makes more than $50,000 a year. As of now the dataset has 1959402 web hits. While it is not clear how exactly Barry Becker collected the data but a set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0)). The dataset contains general information about the individuals like- age, occupation, relationship, native country etc. The dataset has been used by over fifty researchers across the world.
